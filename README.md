Linux Academic Group (LAG) is an interdisciplinary student association for Linux programmers and enthusiasts operating at the Institute of Computer Science of the Pozna≈Ñ University of Technology.

LAGs main goals are to provide its members with space for improving their programming competencies and to increase awareness of modern, open technologies and the benefits they carry, focusing on work around open source operating systems such as Linux or Zephyr.
## Projects

### Rocket Lag Debian

The [Rocket Lag Debian](https://github.com/Linux-Academic-Group/rocket-lag-debian) is a project that we did in collaboration with [PUT Rocketlab](https://rocketlab.put.poznan.pl/) student organisation.

The main goal of the project was to create customized Debian installator which automatically installs minimal debian distribution with necessary essential tools.

The distribution later is used by Rocketlab members in their portable command center to help monitor and control parameters of rockets during tests and launches.
