Linux Academic Group (LAG) is an interdisciplinary student association for Linux programmers and enthusiasts operating at the Institute of Computer Science of the Pozna≈Ñ University of Technology.

LAGs main goals are to provide its members with space for improving their programming competences and to increase awareness of modern, open technologies and the benefits they carry, focusing on work around open source operating systems such as Linux or Zephyr.
## Our work

### Rocket Lag Debian

Rocket Lag Debian is a small project that we did in collaboration with [PUT Rocketlab](https://rocketlab.put.poznan.pl/).
The project is basically a customized Debian installator which automatically installs minimal debian distro with all essential tools.
This distro is used by Rocketlab members in their portable command center that helps them monitor and control parameters of their rockets during tests and launches.

## Useful resources to start from

* [Linux Journey](https://linuxjourney.com/) - is an online set of lessons dedicated to teach you general aspects of Linux systems and command line usage.
* [Missing Computer Science Semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) - is a free set of lectures delivered by Phd students at MIT that will teach you how to master the command-line, use a powerful text editor, fancy features of version control systems, and much more! 
* [Open Source Licensing](https://github.com/readme/guides/open-source-licensing) - provides general knowledge about licenses and how to choose the correct one for your project.
