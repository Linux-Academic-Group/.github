Linux Academic Group aims at associating PUT students interested in learning about operating systems (mainly Linux) and open source software.
Our work so far has been focused mainly on sharing our knowledge and abilities, but we work on open source projects as well.
On this page you will find information about who we are, what our goals are and how to join us.

## Our work

### Rocket Lag Debian

Rocket Lag Debian is a small project that we did in collaboration with [PUT Rocketlab](https://rocketlab.put.poznan.pl/).
The project is basically a customized Debian installator which automatically installs minimal debian distro with all essential tools.
This distro is used by Rocketlab members in their portable command center that helps them monitor and control parameters of their rockets during tests and launches.

## Useful learning resources

If you want to join us, we expect some basic knowledge from you.
Nobody will ask you questions or get upset if you don't know something, these things will help you keep up with our work and meetings.
* [Linux Journey](https://linuxjourney.com/) - this website contains general knowledge about Linux systems and is suitable for both beginner and intermediate linux users
* [Open Source Licensing](https://github.com/readme/guides/open-source-licensing) - of course we don't expect you to have an attorney-level knowledge about licenses, however it is a good thing to know about popular open source licenses like GPL, Apache, MIT or BSD.
